# 💼 Job Skill Classification using NLP
### 👨‍💻 Project Owner : Putanyn Manee 🇹🇭 🙇🏻‍♂️

## 👋 Introduction

Hello! This project is about using computers to understand job descriptions and figure out what skills are needed for different jobs. It's like teaching a computer to read job postings and tell us what skills the job is asking for. 🖥️📝

## 🧪 Data Science in Action

This project is a great example of data science at work! We're using:

- 📊 Data Analysis: We look at lots of job postings to find patterns.
- 🧹 Data Cleaning: We make the messy text from job posts neat and tidy.
- 🤖 Machine Learning: We teach computers to understand job skills.
- 📈 Predictive Modeling: We make models that can guess job skills from descriptions.

It's like being a detective, but for job skills! 🕵️‍♀️🔍

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. We start with a lot of job descriptions. 📚
2. We clean up the text, removing things that aren't helpful. 🧹
3. We turn the words into numbers that the computer can understand. 🔢
4. We use two different ways to guess the skills:
   - Logistic Regression: It's like drawing a line to separate different types of jobs. 📊
   - Naive Bayes: It uses probability to guess the most likely skills. 🎲
5. We test our guesses to see how well they work. 🧪

## 📊 Dataset

We use job postings from LinkedIn. You can find the data here:
[LinkedIn Job Postings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings)

This data has over 124,000 job postings from 2023 and 2024. 🗓️

**Note:** ⚠️ The data files are too big for GitHub. Please download "posting.csv" and "job_skills.csv" from the link above.

## 🎯 What We're Trying to Do

We want to teach the computer to read a job description and tell us what skills are needed for that job. 🧠💡

## 🔧 Tools We Use

1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. TF-IDF (a way to understand which words are important)
4. Bag of Words (counting words)

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. Copy this project to your computer. 💻
2. Download the data files from the link above. ⬇️
3. Put "posting.csv" then rename it to "job_posting.csv" and "job_skills.csv" in the same folder as the project. 📁
4. Run the main program. ▶️

## 📈 What We Found

Our best method (Logistic Regression with Bag of Words) can guess the right skills 81.17% of the time. 🎉

## 🔮 What's Next

- Try other ways to guess skills 🤔
- Use more job postings to teach the computer 📚
- Make a system that can read job postings in real-time ⚡
